<h3>Approach : </h3>
<p>We have used this four dataset for predicting 11 player. For that we have calculated 5 scores :
<ol>
  <li>Bat_score</li>
  <li>Bow_score</li>
  <li>bat_all</li>
  <li>bow_all</li>
  <li>wktkep_score</li>
</ol>


For each player using dataset 3 dataset in that we have taken 33 players of team India and South Africa. And this data set contains match wise data set of a perticular player that they played till date. And the for calculating the scores we have calculated through inning wise, Position wise, Ground wise, etc.. We have taken my factors in account for calculating the scores for more reference we have provided the link of a research paper form <a href='https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/array'>sciencedirect</a>.
</p>

<p>Then we used dataset that contains indian and South Africa's match which contains selection status for world cup 2023 squads for india and south Africa for each match. And according to match date we have calculated the scores. Using that we have predicted the selection status. And we have predicted for worldcup final for indian and south african team. We selected as per the descending probability.</p>
